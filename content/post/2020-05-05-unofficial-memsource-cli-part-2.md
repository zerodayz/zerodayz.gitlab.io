It has been 7 months+ that Memsource CLI has been developed and it is still Rocking!  

Here is our new project logo:

It has been a while since we had last issue reported and that's definitely great sign.  
Now even the Memsource official blog mentions Memsource CLI [https://www.memsource.com/blog/2019/11/07/unofficial-memsource-cli](https://www.memsource.com/blog/2019/11/07/unofficial-memsource-cli)

Currently there are two active developers @Ludek Janda and me.
