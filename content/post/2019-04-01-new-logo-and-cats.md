I like to draw from time to time and this time I have decided to create new logo for my website.
The logo represents letter `R` as initial of my first name `Robin` I agree that it may look like `K` but let me assure you that it isn't.

![New logo](avatar-icon.png){ height=25% }

Also because everyone lovesa `cats`, here is one picture of my favourite cat in different positions.
