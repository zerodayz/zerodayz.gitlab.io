You might be already aware of the other project I am working on [Unofficial Memsource CLI](https://github.com/unofficial-memsource/memsource-cli-client).

Memsource CLI is a framework to help with automation of Memsource related tasks. This empowers you to automate repetitive tasks such as project, job creation, analysis runs and others. The framework is cabable to talk to Memsource API using REST client and show you the results of the execution on the screen.

Please if you have any idea on any improvements please do not hesitate to open an [issue](https://github.com/unofficial-memsource/memsource-cli-client/issues).
