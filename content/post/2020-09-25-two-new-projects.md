It's some time ago I have started on projects written in Go:

[Keepsake](https://github.com/zerodayz/keepsake) is Open Source Wiki written in Go, aims for simplicity over complexity. It is actively maintained and serves as Go development project.

[RCLI](https://github.com/zerodayz/rcli) is Multipurpose CLI written in Go. It can now ssh to thousands of hosts in around 40 seconds. It can start container without docker or podman purely using Linux namespaces.
